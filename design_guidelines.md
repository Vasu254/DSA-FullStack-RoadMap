# B.Tech Learning Roadmap Dashboard - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Framework**: Material Design principles adapted for educational technology, drawing inspiration from Coursera's learning path clarity and GitHub's project roadmap visualization. Focus on information hierarchy, progress visualization, and student-friendly navigation.

**Core Philosophy**: Create an empowering, achievement-oriented interface where students can clearly track their journey from first semester to placement success. Every element should communicate progress, possibility, and accomplishment.
