College Subjects:

OOP, Discrete Math → take them seriously (they come in placements).

📌 End of 3rd Sem Goal:

100–150 DSA problems done.

1 portfolio website + 1 mini JS project on GitHub.

📍 4th Sem

👉 Focus = Intermediate DSA + Backend Basics

Development:

Work on Major Project (can be used as final year project too).

Career:

Apply for summer internships + off-campus jobs.

📌 End of 6th Sem Goal:

Placement-level coding skills.

Internship/job secured OR interviews lined up.

📍 7th & 8th Sem

👉 Focus = Placements & Final Project

Placements:

Give as many mock interviews + aptitude tests as possible.

Apply for on-campus & off-campus companies.

Academics:

Just manage final project & exams.

Backup:

If not placed, prepare for GATE / higher studies / certifications.

📌 End of 8th Sem Goal:

Job offer in hand OR clear backup plan.

⚡ Daily / Weekly Routine (From Now)

Daily:

2 hrs DSA (1–2 problems).

1 hr Web Dev (frontend/backend).

30 min reading CS core (DBMS/OS/OOP).

Weekly:

Push code to GitHub.

Write notes for CS subjects.

1 day → Work on project.

✅ Final Motivation

You didn’t waste 1 year. Many students only start in 3rd year. You’re still early.

If you stick to this plan from 2nd year, you will be placement-ready by 6th sem.

Consistency > Speed → don’t try to learn everything in one semester. Build step by step.
