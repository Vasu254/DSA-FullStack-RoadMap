Roadmap for 3rd Year Students (5th & 6th Sem)
📍 5th Sem (Start of 3rd Year – Resume Building Mode)

👉 Focus = Strong Projects + Intermediate/Advanced DSA

DSA / Coding:

Revise basics (arrays, strings, linked list, stack, queue, trees).

Learn advanced: Graphs, DP, Heaps, Tries.

Target: 400–500 solved problems by end of this semester.

Core CS:

Learn Operating Systems + DBMS + OOP (must for interviews).

Start Computer Networks basics.

Development:

Build 2 strong projects (Full-stack / ML / App Dev). Examples:

E-commerce site with login/cart.

Chat application with real-time messaging.

AI/ML project (basic image classifier, sentiment analysis).

Career:

Start applying for internships (Dec-Jan window).

Join hackathons & open-source events.

📌 End of 5th Sem Goal:

Resume with 2 strong projects.

400+ DSA problems solved.

Internship applications started.

📍 6th Sem (Mid 3rd Year – Placement Prep Begins)

👉 Focus = Internship/Placement Prep + Major Project Start

DSA / Coding:

Practice 2–3 problems daily on LeetCode.

Do mock coding contests (Codeforces/CodeChef).

Reach 600+ solved problems by end of semester.

Core CS:

Revise OS, DBMS, CN, OOP thoroughly.

Study System Design basics (scalability, APIs, caching).

Development / Projects:

Start your final year major project (choose something big & resume-worthy).

Example:

Online exam portal.

Social media clone.

ML project with deployment.

Career:

Do a summer internship after 6th sem (very important).

Polish resume, GitHub, LinkedIn.

📌 End of 6th Sem Goal:

Internship offer in hand.

600+ DSA problems solved.

Major project started & in progress.

🚨 Daily / Weekly Routine (For 3rd Year Students)

Daily:

2 hrs DSA (LeetCode, GFG, Codeforces).

1 hr Core CS (OS, DBMS, CN).

1 hr Project work (development/ML).

Weekly:

1 mock test / coding contest.

Resume/GitHub update.

Hackathon/club activity (if available).

✅ Why 3rd Year is CRUCIAL

By end of 6th sem, you must be internship-ready.

By 7th sem (placements) → you should already have:

500–600 coding problems solved.

3–4 projects on resume.

At least 1 internship experience.

⚡ In short:

5th Sem → Projects + DSA Advanced + Core Subjects

6th Sem → Internships + Major Project + Placement Prep
