Roadmap for 4th Year Students (7th & 8th Sem)
📍 7th Sem (Start of Final Year – Placements!)

👉 Focus = Placement season + Major Project progress

DSA / Coding:

Focus on revision, not new topics.

Daily 2–3 problems (arrays, strings, DP, trees, graphs).

Do mock interviews & coding contests.

Core CS (very important in interviews):

Revise OOP, OS, DBMS, CN.

Be able to explain concepts + write SQL queries.

Major Project:

Start building your final year capstone project (should be resume-worthy).

Example:

E-learning platform.

Social media app.

AI/ML project with deployment.

Career / Placements:

Apply to on-campus companies (service & product based).

Start off-campus applications (LinkedIn, Naukri, company portals).

Practice aptitude + HR interview questions.

📌 End of 7th Sem Goal:

Resume updated with projects + internship.

At least 1–2 interview experiences done.

Major project in progress.

📍 8th Sem (Last Semester – Final Push)

Placements / Off-campus:

If placed → relax a bit, just maintain academics.

If not placed → keep applying to off-campus jobs daily.

Do mock interviews with friends/seniors.

Major Project:

Complete & polish final year project.

Prepare PPT + demo (sometimes companies ask).

Higher Studies Backup (if not placed):

GATE prep (if aiming for PSU/M.Tech).

GRE/TOEFL/IELTS (if MS abroad).

Certifications (Cloud, ML, Data Science) if planning specialization.

Soft Skills:

Improve communication, teamwork, presentation (important in HR rounds).

📌 End of 8th Sem Goal:

Job offer in hand OR solid plan for higher studies.

Final project submitted & demo-ready.

✅ Daily / Weekly Routine (4th Year)

Projects → Final year project should be impressive & presentable.

Job → On-campus is priority, off-campus as backup.

Higher Studies → Keep as Plan B if placements fail.

⚡ In short:

7th Sem → Placements + Major Project (start)
